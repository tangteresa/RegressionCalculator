# RegressionCalculator
**Language:** Python

**Purpose:** Calculates `normalized jerk`, a measure of arm movement smoothness, which is used to assess stroke patient rehabilitation progress. Takes raw arm joint position data, performs nonlinear regression on data by iterating through different equation types (i.e. cubic, quadratic, etc) to find the line of best fit with which to caclulate normalized jerk. Plots regression equation with original data plot for regression accuracy assessment.
